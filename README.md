# Gear to Peer - Musical instrument database, for musicians
Gear to Peer is a site designed for musicians to store and track data related to their musical equipment.

Upon logging in with Google authentication, the user will come to their home/collection page. Here they will see a welcome message if no gear is available, with options to add new items. When the user selects the "+" icon to add an item they will be taken to the "Add to Collection" form where they will be asked to input gear data. 

On the form, there is a dropdown menu to specify the category of the new item at the top. They will select - Guitar, Bass, Keyboard, Drums, Microphones, Amplifiers, Recording, Pedals, or Misc. Next they will input the item's brand, model and year (required). There are two more options to add general notes and maintenence notes. There are three private fields on the form - Serial number, amount paid and amount sold. These fields will not transfer to the tour section and will only be visible by the primary user.

Once the new item has been added, users will be taken to the "gear view". Here they will be able to view, update or delete/archive the item. I want to encourage users to archive their items instead of deleting them. It's always fun to look back at old items and see how much you paid for gear. But the delete option will be available.

The tour section is a way to track gear used in a tour or temporary situation. When you click on Tour in the navbar you'll see boards similar to the collection view and an option to add a new tour at the top. A modal will appear when the new tour option is selected, showing available gear with a radial button next to the item thumbnail and description. Once the user has selected the items they like, they will add them to the tour by clicking an "add to tour" button at the top.

When items are in the tour section, users will be able to view the selected gear and also add "tour notes" to the items. Tour notes will only be available in the tour section and will not modify the existing entry within the collection.
